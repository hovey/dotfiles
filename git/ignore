# To have Git use your ~/dotfiles/git/ignore file as your global .gitignore, you need
# to set the core.excludesfile configuration variable. You don't "source" it in the
# typical shell script sense.
# 
# Here's how you do it:
# 
# git config --global core.excludesfile ~/dotfiles/git/ignore
#
# Explanation:
# 
# git config: This command is used to get and set Git configuration options.
# 
# --global: This flag specifies that the configuration change should apply to all your Git repositories on your system (for your user). This is the correct scope for a global ignore file.
# 
# core.excludesfile: This is the specific Git configuration variable that tells Git where to find your global ignore file.
# 
# ~/dotfiles/git/ignore: This is the path to your custom global ignore file. Git will automatically expand ~ to your home directory.
